# Sass Rails Source Maps

NOTE: This gem is probably __not working__ because it depends on `sass` version `3.3` and higher. Until `sass-rails` [issue](https://github.com/rails/sass-rails/pull/192) is resolved, you can try [sass-rails-5.0.0.beta1](https://github.com/vhyza/sass-rails-source-maps/tree/sass-rails-5.0.0.beta1) branch.

This gem allows you to see your Rails 4 `.scss` source files in Google Chrome inspector, which can be useful for debugging.

`debug_info` option available in stable [sass](http://sass-lang.com/) gem is no longer working in Google Chrome, because Chrome now supports Source Map [v3](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1U1RGAehQwRypUTovF1KRlpiOFze0b-_2gc6fAH0KY0k) only.

## Installation

Add this to your application's Gemfile :

````ruby
group :development do
  gem 'sass-rails-source-maps'
end
````

And then execute:

    $ bundle update sass

to use `sass` gem with Source Maps v3 support, which is currently pre-release version.

After that, run:

    $ rake assets:clobber

to make Rails regenerate assets. After assets regeneration, `assets/source_maps` containing `sass` source maps is created in `public` directory.

## Usage

To see something like this ![screenshot](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/21012539/screenshots/screenshot.png) you need to enable source maps in Google Chrome.

To enable source maps open Chrome inspector go to [chrome://flags/#enable-devtools-experiments](chrome://flags/#enable-devtools-experiments) and `Enable Developer Tools experiments`. Then restart Google Chrome.

After restart, go to inspector `Experiments` settings and enable `Sass stylesheet debugging`.

And finally in `General` settings check `Enable source maps`.

Enabling source maps may vary in different Chrome versions. For more info please see [Working with CSS Preprocessors](https://developers.google.com/chrome-developer-tools/docs/css-preprocessors); part _Using Sass with CSS source maps_.

## Notes
* This gem is Rails 4 compatible only
* If you wan't to see `coffeescript` files in Google Chrome inspector you can use [coffee-rails-source-maps](https://github.com/markbates/coffee-rails-source-maps) gem.
